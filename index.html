<p>29 May - 2 June 2017</p>

<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>

<p>This symposium is to be held in Australia in conjunction with CSIRO's annual computing and informatics conference. 
  The co-location of these two events will particularly support the bridge from information to large scale computation. 
  A number of sponsors are supporting the symposium to bring key international contributors to Australia to participate in this unique event. </p>

<a id="context" class="anchor" href="#context" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Context</h2>

<p>We live in the Information Age with an unprecedented wealth of data surrounding us. Society is being transformed through the connection of data - from databases, archives, sensors and models - to analytics and other services. Working at the boundaries of computational and environmental sciences, breakthroughs in enviroinformatics multiply the convergence already underway in natural sciences*. However, bringing environmental data to the party is proving difficult as they are scattered across many organizations in formal and informal ways, expressed using many standards, and also frequently depending on physical samples taken from the real world. </p>

<p>Challenges are technical, social, and institutional. On the technical side, the web paradigm of Linked Data promises a breakthrough in linked, science-ready information from persistent sources. A growing community of earth and environmental scientists, working on the interface with computational science, are developing detailed practices and standards around identifiers, vocabularies, and software interfaces, which are necessary for wider community application. Currently, these efforts are fragmented, as is the communication of technical solutions and organisational best practices. Linked Environmental Data and Samples will bring together thought-leaders in the computational-environmental sciences convergence space, with the goal of triggering the adoption of uniform practices across Australia and internationally.</p>

<p>Most environmental science projects and assessments require data from a variety of sources. Data structures are usually tailored to the particular context in which they were created. Transforming data to make it suitable for reuse involves educated guesses about its structure, and the meaning of embedded abbreviations and codes. Links to samples, and to features on the real world from these were taken, are often ambiguous. Data discovery depends too often on informal networks.  This fragmentation imposes significant costs on projects, with as much as 80% of project effort spent on identifying and cleaning existing data.</p>

<p>‘Data’ has been a relative latecomer to the World Wide Web. While 'Analytics' and 'Big Data' have been fashionable, conventions and standards for accessing and sharing datasets have been weak. The  World Wide Web Consortium proposed general guidelines for ‘Linked Open Data’, focussing on identifiers and protocols, along with some general expectations about file formats. Force11 developed the FAIR principles for scientific data, highlighting the need to pay attention to metadata and content standards. However, specific community practices and standards are required for each application domain.</p>

<p>Environmental and earth science data is collected by a large number of organizations, in both public and private sectors, with a heavy focus on observations and spatial data. The emerging frontiers in enviroinformatics use the tools of computer science, but are dependent on deep knowledge of the earth and environmental sciences. There is a plethora of data standards, and weak governance around controlled vocabularies, even in such basic concerns as units-of-measure. Linked Data solutions have been trialled, but scattered around a number of forums and initiatives in both environmental and computer sciences, and not yet broadly shared and deployed, or fully joined up.</p>

<p>The symposium will bring together key people working in informatics from a number of discipline-based communities who have been leading developments in enviroinformatics, including biodiversity, ecology, hydrology, marine data, environmental monitoring, and solid earth sciences. A particular focus will be on linking data to samples, specimens and artefacts as ground-truth to our data, which in turn should be (but often are not) unambiguously related to the real-world features they are designed to characterize. The symposium will features examinations of state-of-the-art systems, with working sessions to help advance consensus within and, particularly between the disciplinary communities that make up the environmental sciences. The design of the symposium will build on the experience of the highly successful Earth Science Information Partnership (ESIP) series that has been running for more than two decades in North America. </p>
